## Features
### This is a very slick looking webpage and good showcase for this company.  Some very compelling marketing.

## Installation
### Start by going to my github, and clone the code in VScode, then run the website.  I'm happy to give the code to anyone who wants to pay to host this website.

## Credits
### We used VScode, html, css, a computer, and the internet to get this job done.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
  
## Learning
### We learned a bit about html semantics and how important it is to read a little more carefully so you don't miss those special details.
